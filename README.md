A Ligbtweigbt, C Compiler meant for extended use on Coffee-OS. Out of inspiration, and whilst already on the topic
of language and compiler design. I found building something which I could modify freely and use independently of any
sources or external files (as this was important considering the operating system). Support for multiple platforms and
can be used on its own. It's recommended to be used on Coffee OS Architecture.

Originally built for making my own C and C++ development tools, along the way I picked up numerous skills and dense knowledge
about the almost forgotten low-level world. Additionality to this, as well as a good chunk of time spent on LLVM, I've started
to pick up on how all the different parts fit in to the pipeline - My attempt at showing this is Through CoffeeOS' Version of
C, ElivyianC
