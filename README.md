# KYCC - Kyle's C Compiler

A Ligbtweigbt, C Compiler meant for extended use on Coffee-OS. Out of inspiration, and whilst already on the topic
of language and compiler design. I found building something which I could modify freely and use independently of any
sources or external files (as this was important considering the operating system). Support for multiple platforms and
can be used on its own. It's recommended to be used on Coffee OS Architecture

# Installation

  Run the ```builder.exe``` file.
